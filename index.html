            <div class="content">
                
                <p>My name is Lazaro Felizardo Matola, I'm 40 years old and I'm married to a wonderful woman who gave me three beautiful children. My oldest child is 19 years old, the middle one is 10 years old and the last one is just 5 years old.
                    I'm so happy because my eldest son is going to serve a mission in Brazil, as he will be the first missionary in the family.
                    I really enjoy learning and helping others.
                    I'm taking a computer science course and it's been very challenging, as I have to divide my time between studying, working and taking care of my family.
                    I hope I can learn a lot in this class.              
                </p>

                    Mozambique is a country on the eastern coast of Southern Africa, 
                    bordered by: to the north, Tanzania; to the northwest, Malawi and Zambia;
                    to the west, Zimbabwe, South Africa and Swaziland; to the south, South Africa;
                    to the east, the section of the Indian Ocean known as the Mozambique Channel.
                    In the Mozambique Channel, neighbors are Madagascar and the Comoros (including
                    the French possession of Mayotte). In the Indian Ocean, to the east of the large
                    island of Madagascar, are the dependencies of Réunion, Juan de Nova and Europa Island.
                    In the Mozambique Channel, approximately halfway between the continent and Madagascar, 
                    the Bassas da India atoll, also a French possession.
                    The capital of Mozambique is Maputo (it was called by Lourenço Marques during 
                    Portuguese domination).
